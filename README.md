# The-Sofia

Here write your ideas for the story:

-Damned by Zeus to suffer eternaly for her crimes
- shes a demigod of Hades and someone
- She is rescued from Labyrinth by Hades
-Hades now wants her help for the rescuing
-Hades has a plan to kill all gods and become the one and only god
-So you are killing the 'good' characters in greek mythology plus some low level gods
-Zeus eventually finds out
-He then puts you to this cycle where you have to face every one you murdered for hades
-final boss is Zeus, overpowered , almost every time will kill you(repeating the whole process) if you kill him youll break the loop and free yourself(you go to heaven)
- youll be discovering your past through finding your memories in the loop(might be some minigames like in FNAF or some animation)
